    - 'Barbell glute bridge '
    - "1. Begin seated on the ground with a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a
      fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused
      by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lay
      down flat on the floor.\r\n2. Begin the movement by driving through with your
      heels, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be
      supported by your upper back and the heels of your feet.\r\n3. Extend as far
      as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position."

      under your hips with your feet turned out slightly. Grip the bar with a double
      overhand grip or hook grip, about shoulder width apart. Squat down to the bar.
      Your spine should be in full extension, with a back angle that places your shoulders
      in front of the bar and your back as vertical as possible.\r\n2. Begin by driving
      through the floor through the front of your heels. As the bar travels upward,
      maintain a constant back angle. Flare your knees out to the side to help keep
      them out of the bar's path.\r\n3. After the bar crosses the knees, complete
      the lift by driving the hips into the bar until your hips and knees are extended."

      Curl the bar up in a semicircular motion until the forearms touch your biceps.
      Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and contract your biceps
      hard for a second at the top. Tip: Avoid bending the back or using swinging
      motions as you lift the weight. Only the forearms should move.\r\n4. Slowly

      of you at about upper chest level with your palms facing your body and your
      elbows bent. Tip: arms should be next to your torso. The starting position should
      look like the contracted portion of a dumbbell curl.\r\n2. To perform the movement,
      raise the dumbbells as you rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing
      forward.\r\n3. Continue lifting the dumbbells until your arms are extended above
      you in straight arm position. Breathe out as you perform this portion of the
      movement.\r\n4. After a second pause at the top, begin to lower the dumbbells
      to the original position by rotating the palms of your hands towards you. Tip:
      The left arm will be rotated in a counter clockwise manner while the right one
      will be rotated clockwise. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement."

      exercise, you will need to put your hands beside your head. Be careful however
      to not strain with the neck as you perform it. Now lift your shoulders into
      the crunch position.\r\n2. Bring knees up to where they are perpendicular to
      the floor, with your lower legs parallel to the floor. This will be your starting
      position.\r\n3. Simultaneously, slowly go through a cycle pedal motion kicking
      forward with the right leg and bringing in the knee of the left leg. Bring your
      right elbow close to your left knee by crunching to the side, as you breathe
      out.\r\n4. Go back to the initial position as you breathe in.\r\nCrunch to the
      opposite side as you cycle your legs and bring closer your left elbow to your

      on the ground. Raise your arms up and turn the rope over your head bringing
      it down in front of you. \r\n3. When it reaches the ground, jump over it. Find
      a good turning pace that can be maintained. Different speeds and techniques
      can be used to introduce variation.\r\nRope jumping is fun, challenges your
      coordination, and requires a lot of energy. A 150 lb person will burn about
      350 calories jumping rope for 30 minutes, compared to over 450 calories running."

      Wear protective gear to avoid possible injury. Ensure that you are courteous
      to vehicles and pedestrians, and that you obey the rules of the road.\r\n3.
      Cycling offers convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and has less impact than
      other activities. A 150 lb person will burn about 280 calories cycling at a
      moderate rate for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories or more running."

    - Trail running/walking
    - "1. Running or hiking on trails will get the blood pumping and heart beating
      almost immediately. Make sure you have good shoes. While you use the muscles
      in your calves and buttocks to pull yourself up a hill, the knees, joints and
      ankles absorb the bulk of the pounding coming back down. Take smaller steps
      as you walk downhill, keep your knees bent to reduce the impact and slow down
      to avoid falling.\r\nA 150 lb person can burn over 200 calories for 30 minutes
      walking uphill, compared to 175 on a flat surface. If running the trail, a 150
      lb person can burn well over 500 calories in 30 minutes."

      until you raise your hips off of the floor by rolling your pelvis backward.
      Breathe out as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: At the end of
      the movement your knees will be over your chest.\r\n5. Squeeze your abs at the
      top of the movement for a second and then return to the starting position slowly
      as you breathe in. Tip: Maintain a controlled motion at all times.\r\n6. Repeat\r\nVariations:

      a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the
      upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your
      arms locked. This will be your starting position.\r\n2. From the starting position,
      breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.\r\n3.
      After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe
      out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. \r\n4. Lock your arms
      and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion,
      hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. \r\nTip: Ideally,
      lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.\r\nRepeat
      the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\r\nWhen you are done,
      place the bar back in the rack."

    - "1. Put weight on one of the ends of an Barbell. Make sure that you either place
      the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object
      on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward.\r\n2. Bend forward until
      your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees
      slightly bent.\r\n3. Now grab the bar with both arms just behind the plates
      on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee.
      This will be your starting position.\r\n4. Pull the bar straight up with your
      elbows in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest.
      \r\n5. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second
      at the top of the movement. \r\n6. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip:
      Use a stirrup or double handle cable attachment by hooking it under the end
      of the bar.\r\nSlowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice
      stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the
      best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed
      to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones).\r\nRepeat."

    - Cardio
    - Swimming
    - "Swimming can support up to 90% of the body’s weight in the water. It also means
      you gain a full body workout. Because water is about 800 times denser than air,
      you can work harder, and burn more calories, in a pool than out of it. Different
      swimming strokes challenge different muscles within the body so you can choose
      where you tone up.\r\nSwimming lengthens and strengthens your muscles. It is
      the constant water-resistance, against any movement in any direction, that forces
      your muscles to simultaneously contract and stretch, creating flexible and resilient
      muscle fibers. In freestyle and backstroke, your arms pull and push underwater,
      but you also must maintain your torso's position in the water itself so you're
      exercising not only your triceps, biceps and deltoids but also your abdominals,
      gluteals, ribcage intercostals, chest pectorals and hip stabilizers. In freestyle
      and backstroke, you use a flutter kick, engaging predominantly your quadriceps
      in the freestyle, hamstrings in the backstroke, and to a lesser degree, your
      calf and foot muscles."

    - Bicycle crunch
    - "1. Lie on your back and bring your knees up toward your chest. Place your hands
      behind your head with your elbows extended out and lift your head and shoulders
      off of the mat.\r\nTip: Do not pull on your neck, you should be lifting with
      your abdominals.\r\n2. Now extend one leg out as you twist your body so that
      your elbow comes toward the opposite bent knee.   Keep your shoulders off the
      floor. Focus your eyes toward the lower elbow and do not allow the elbows to
      fold in toward each other.\r\n3. Now inhale as you twist in the opposite direction
      pulling the extended leg in towards you while simultaneously extending the other
      leg. Keep the extended leg 6 to 10 inches off the floor. Be sure to stretch
      the leg out long and with control. Keep the abdominals contracted and your low
      back pressed into the mat.\r\n4. Exhale completely to complete the repetition.\r\n5.
      When you have finished, hug both of your knees into your chest and hold for
      thirty seconds or more to stretch out your back.\r\n"

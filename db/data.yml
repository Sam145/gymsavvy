    - 'Barbell glute bridge '
    - "1. Begin seated on the ground with a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a
      fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused
      by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lay
      down flat on the floor.\r\n2. Begin the movement by driving through with your
      heels, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be
      supported by your upper back and the heels of your feet.\r\n3. Extend as far
      as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position."

      overhand grip or hook grip, about shoulder width apart. Squat down to the bar.
      Your spine should be in full extension, with a back angle that places your shoulders
      in front of the bar and your back as vertical as possible.\r\n2. Begin by driving
      through the floor through the front of your heels. As the bar travels upward,
      maintain a constant back angle. Flare your knees out to the side to help keep
      them out of the bar's path.\r\n3. After the bar crosses the knees, complete
      the lift by driving the hips into the bar until your hips and knees are extended."

      elbows bent. Tip: arms should be next to your torso. The starting position should
      look like the contracted portion of a dumbbell curl.\r\n2. To perform the movement,
      raise the dumbbells as you rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing
      forward.\r\n3. Continue lifting the dumbbells until your arms are extended above
      you in straight arm position. Breathe out as you perform this portion of the
      movement.\r\n4. After a second pause at the top, begin to lower the dumbbells
      to the original position by rotating the palms of your hands towards you. Tip:
      The left arm will be rotated in a counter clockwise manner while the right one
      will be rotated clockwise. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement."

      the floor, with your lower legs parallel to the floor. This will be your starting
      position.\r\n3. Simultaneously, slowly go through a cycle pedal motion kicking
      forward with the right leg and bringing in the knee of the left leg. Bring your
      right elbow close to your left knee by crunching to the side, as you breathe
      out.\r\n4. Go back to the initial position as you breathe in.\r\nCrunch to the
      opposite side as you cycle your legs and bring closer your left elbow to your

      on the ground. Raise your arms up and turn the rope over your head bringing
      it down in front of you. \r\n3. When it reaches the ground, jump over it. Find
      a good turning pace that can be maintained. Different speeds and techniques
      can be used to introduce variation.\r\nRope jumping is fun, challenges your
      coordination, and requires a lot of energy. A 150 lb person will burn about
      350 calories jumping rope for 30 minutes, compared to over 450 calories running."

      Wear protective gear to avoid possible injury. Ensure that you are courteous
      to vehicles and pedestrians, and that you obey the rules of the road.\r\n3.
      Cycling offers convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and has less impact than
      other activities. A 150 lb person will burn about 280 calories cycling at a
      moderate rate for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories or more running."

    - Trail running/walking
    - "1. Running or hiking on trails will get the blood pumping and heart beating
      almost immediately. Make sure you have good shoes. While you use the muscles
      in your calves and buttocks to pull yourself up a hill, the knees, joints and
      ankles absorb the bulk of the pounding coming back down. Take smaller steps
      as you walk downhill, keep your knees bent to reduce the impact and slow down
      to avoid falling.\r\nA 150 lb person can burn over 200 calories for 30 minutes
      walking uphill, compared to 175 on a flat surface. If running the trail, a 150
      lb person can burn well over 500 calories in 30 minutes."

      maintain the 75 degree angle bend in your legs. \r\n4. Continue this movement
      until you raise your hips off of the floor by rolling your pelvis backward.
      Breathe out as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: At the end of
      the movement your knees will be over your chest.\r\n5. Squeeze your abs at the
      top of the movement for a second and then return to the starting position slowly

      a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the
      upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your
      arms locked. This will be your starting position.\r\n2. From the starting position,
      breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.\r\n3.
      After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe
      out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. \r\n4. Lock your arms
      and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion,
      hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. \r\nTip: Ideally,
      lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.\r\nRepeat
      the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\r\nWhen you are done,
      place the bar back in the rack."

    - "1. Put weight on one of the ends of an Barbell. Make sure that you either place
      the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object
      on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward.\r\n2. Bend forward until
      your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees
      slightly bent.\r\n3. Now grab the bar with both arms just behind the plates
      on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee.
      This will be your starting position.\r\n4. Pull the bar straight up with your
      elbows in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest.
      \r\n5. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second
      at the top of the movement. \r\n6. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip:
      Use a stirrup or double handle cable attachment by hooking it under the end
      of the bar.\r\nSlowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice
      stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the
      best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed
      to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones).\r\nRepeat."

    - Cardio
    - Swimming
    - "Swimming can support up to 90% of the body’s weight in the water. It also means
      you gain a full body workout. Because water is about 800 times denser than air,
      you can work harder, and burn more calories, in a pool than out of it. Different
      swimming strokes challenge different muscles within the body so you can choose
      where you tone up.\r\nSwimming lengthens and strengthens your muscles. It is
      the constant water-resistance, against any movement in any direction, that forces
      your muscles to simultaneously contract and stretch, creating flexible and resilient
      muscle fibers. In freestyle and backstroke, your arms pull and push underwater,
      but you also must maintain your torso's position in the water itself so you're
      exercising not only your triceps, biceps and deltoids but also your abdominals,
      gluteals, ribcage intercostals, chest pectorals and hip stabilizers. In freestyle
      and backstroke, you use a flutter kick, engaging predominantly your quadriceps
      in the freestyle, hamstrings in the backstroke, and to a lesser degree, your
      calf and foot muscles."

    - Dumbell lying one arm rear lateral raise
    - "1. While holding a dumbbell in one hand, lay with your chest down on a slightly
      inclined (around 15 degrees when measured from the floor) adjustable bench.
      The other hand can be used to hold to the leg of the bench for stability.\r\nPosition
      the palm of the hand that is holding the dumbbell in a neutral manner (palms
      facing your torso) as you keep the arm extended with the elbow slightly bent.
      This will be your starting position.\r\n2. Raise the arm with the dumbbell to
      the side until your elbow is at shoulder height and your arm is roughly parallel
      to the floor as you exhale. \r\nTip: Maintain your arm perpendicular to the
      torso while keeping your arm extended throughout the movement. Also, keep the
      contraction at the top for a second.\r\n3. Slowly lower the dumbbell to the
      starting position as you inhale.\r\nRepeat."

      Keep your whole body as straight as possible. \r\nTip: If doing this for the
      first time, have a spotter help you. Also, make sure that you keep facing the
      wall with your head, rather than looking down.\r\n3. Slowly lower yourself to
      the ground as you inhale until your head almost touches the floor. \r\nTip:
      It is of utmost importance that you come down slow in order to avoid head injury.\r\n4.

      Grasp the ends using a pronated (palms facing your thighs) grip that is slightly
      less than shoulder width. Your hands should be resting on the sides of your
      thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your
      back should be straight. This will be your starting position.\r\n3. Use your
      side shoulders to lift the Bands to the sides as you exhale. Continue to lift
      your arms until they are slightly above parallel. \r\nTip: As you lift your
      hands, slightly tilt the hand as if you were pouring water and keep your arms
      extended. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top

    - "1. Select the correct weight for you to row. The weight should be something
      that you can do for full repetitions. You may have to experiment to find your
      proper weight of the dumbbell.\r\n\r\n2. Start with the dumbbell on the floor
      next to the weight bench, on the side of the arm that you plan to use. Place
      your opposite hand on the bench, as well as your knee on the opposite side.
      If you are using your right hand, your left hand and left knee will be on the
      bench, spaced comfortably for stability. Your right leg should be placed in
      a spot where you have the most comfort and stability when holding the weight.Grip
      the dumbbell and lift it off the floor, letting the weight hang straight down.
      Your back should remain straight throughout the exercise.\r\n3. Once you are
      holding the weight, you are ready to begin the repetition. At this point, you
      should be bent at the waist, but maintaining a straight back. Your back should
      be slightly above parallel to the floor, and your head up, looking straight
      ahead.Keeping your back straight and your head up, pull the dumbbell straight
      up, bending your arm at the elbow. Your elbow should go up higher than your
      back, allowing the barbell to be rowed all the way up to your body. The emphasis
      of this exercise is on your back, not your biceps, so be sure to focus there
      and squeeze your back at the top.\r\n4. For the negative, simply release the
      barbell back down to the bottom position. Do not drop the weight, rather control
      it down. Remember, this is not an arm exercise, allow your back to do all the
      work. When you can no longer pull the dumbbell all the way into your body, you
      can do no more.\r\n5. Switch to your other arm and repeat the same amount of
      sets and repetitions."

      ball to come straight toward the floor as you sit. Squat down until the medicine
      ball lightly touches the floor.\r\n3. From the squat, look up at the ceiling
      and press explosively through your legs to bring yourself back to standing,
      bringing the medicine ball up with you as you rise, and keeping it close to
      your body as you lift it to shoulder level.\r\n4. As you reach your standing
      position, \"flick\" the ball up until your arms are straight overhead, using
      a swift, strong motion, and then, without breaking your upward momentum, throw
      the ball as high as you can into the air.\r\n5. While the ball is in the air,

    - Pilates side leg series
    - "1. Lie on your side with your legs and feet slightly in front of you.\r\n2.
      Pull your abdominals in (right below the belly button).\r\n3. Lift your chest.\r\n4.
      Roll your shoulders back and down.\r\n5. Press your shoulder blades down towards
      your hips.\r\nYour head can be down or resting on your hand , but lengthen your
      neck.\r\nLengthen your legs as long as you can (reach your feet away from you).\r\n\r\nSide
      Kicks: Forward & Back\r\nHow far forward can you slowly kick without rounding
      your spine?\r\nHow far back can you slowly swing the leg without arching your
      spine?\r\nKeep reaching your top leg out as long as you can.\r\nOnce you do
      a few reps with a smooth swing, you can add a small double beat (pulse) kick
      at the front for two, then behind for two.\r\nNo upper body movement!\r\n\r\nDouble
      Leg Beat\r\nWith the toe pointing up, lift the top leg as high as you can (keep
      your chest open).\r\nLower the top leg, longer than the bottom leg.\r\nAfter
      you do a few slow reps, speed up the move and add a double beat (pulse) down
      into the lower leg.\r\nAs you speed up, you stay controlled through the movement.\r\n\r\nLeg
      Circles\r\nLift top leg a few inches off of the bottom leg and trace circles
      forward and backward.\r\nTake your leg back a little bit (shown below) and perform
      same circles.\r\n\r\nGluteus Medius Leg Lifts\r\nWith your leg back, do small
      leg lifts leading with your heel.\r\nOnly lift and lower the leg to a point
      where you can keep your hips still and don’t collapse in the ribcage.\r\nPicture
      shown below is at the top of the move.\r\n\r\nHot Potato: Top Leg\r\nDip your
      toe down in front of your body, then arch your foot behind.\r\nDip toe down
      behind, then arch back to the front.\r\nTry keeping your top hand right on your
      hip so you focus on keeping that hip down away from your ribcage.\r\n\r\nSide
      Lying Bicycle\r\nHow big can you make the “pedal stroke” without moving through
      the upper body?\r\nPerform your pedal stroke forward for a few reps, then backwards.\r\nAdd
      your arm, to increase core instability.  When your leg is back, move your arm
      forward and kick the leg to your hand.\r\n\r\nIf laying on your side is uncomfortable
      or it is just too challenging, you can perform these exercises from a standing
      position \r\nTry rotating your palms forward to emphasize retracting the shoulder
      blades.\r\n\r\n"

    - Exercise ball squats
    - "1. Place an exercise ball against a wall.\r\n2. Stand up straight with your
      lower back firmly against the ball.\r\n3. Bend your knees to roll the ball down
      the wall. Continue until you have reached a \"mini-squat\" (1/3 of a full squat)
      position.\r\n4. Push through your heels to roll the ball back to the starting
      position.\r\nTip : To make this exercise more challenging, dip down lower. \r\nTry
      to get all the way in to a full squat!\r\n"
